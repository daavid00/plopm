abstract = {The Open Porous Media (OPM) initiative is a community effort that encourages open innovation and reproducible research for simulation of porous media processes. OPM coordinates collaborative software development, maintains and distributes open-source software and open data sets, and seeks to ensure that these are available under a free license in a long-term perspective. In this paper, we present OPM Flow, which is a reservoir simulator developed for industrial use, as well as some of the individual components used to make OPM Flow.

Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.

	abstract = {The 11th SPE Comparative Solution Project (SPE11) was established to benchmark the ability of reservoir simulators to capture the key physical processes of geological carbon dioxide (CO2) storage. A central question in this project was whether grid refinement could yield converged solutions for quantities of practical interest. In this work, we revisit Case B, perceived to be the easiest benchmark, using the open-source simulator OPM Flow (The Open Porous Media Initiative). Building on the most highly resolved submission to SPE11, we conduct systematic refinement studies on facies-aligned corner-point grids, extending the resolution down to the submeter scale and beyond in a localized subdomain.Convergence is assessed not for dense reporting fields, but rather for the 13 sparse measures defined in SPE11, which act as proxies for operational risks such as overburden disturbance, leakage, dissolution dynamics, and migration into low-permeability seals. We find that pressures at observation points converge robustly even on coarse grids, whereas measures related to phase partitioning and dissolution exhibit strong grid sensitivity, and in several cases, no clear convergence, even at the finest resolutions considered. In particular, the onset and development of convective dissolution fingers remain highly resolution-dependent, underscoring the challenges of resolving small-scale processes in field-scale models.These results highlight that while some operationally critical quantities can be simulated with confidence, others remain elusive under straightforward grid refinement. The findings emphasize the need for complementary approaches---such as upscaled models or proxy measures---to ensure reliable predictions for large-scale CO2 storage operations.},

	abstract = {We present a history matching (HM) workflow applied to the International FluidFlower benchmark study dataset, which features high-resolution images of CO{\$}{\$}{\_}2{\$}{\$}storage in a meter-scale, geologically complex reservoir. The dataset provides dense spatial and temporal observations of fluid displacement, offering a rare opportunity to validate and enhance HM techniques for geological carbon storage (GCS). The combination of detailed experimental data and direct visual observation of flow behavior at this scale is novel and valuable. This study explores the potential and limitations of using experimental data to calibrate standard models for GCS simulation. By leveraging high-resolution images and resulting interpretations of fluid phase distributions, we adjust uncertain parameters and reduce the mismatch between simulation results and observed data. Simulations are performed using the open-source OPM Flow simulator, while the open-source Everest decision-making tool is employed to conduct the HM. After the HM process, the final simulation results show good agreement with the experimental CO{\$}{\$}{\_}2{\$}{\$}storage data. This suggests that the system can be effectively described using standard flow equations, conventional saturation functions, and typical PVT properties for CO{\$}{\$}{\_}2{\$}{\$}--brine mixtures. Our results demonstrate that the Wasserstein distance is a particularly effective metric for matching multi-phase, multi-component flow data. The entire workflow is implemented in a Python package named pofff (Python OPM Flow FluidFlower), which organizes all functionality through a single input file. This design ensures reproducibility and facilitates future extensions of the study.},

	abstract = {We study the effect of different parameters such as injection rate, permeability, and capillary pressure (grouped as capillary number) on salt precipitation and CO2 propagation within the reservoir during intermittent injections. Recent development in the open-source OPM Flow simulator allows to include salt precipitation in CO2 storage simulations. The logarithmic extension for the capillary pressure curve on the dry-out zone and the Killough model for hysteresis are adopted. To set up the reservoir grid, schedule in the injection, and rock and fluid properties, we have developed an open-source framework in Python. Then, the setting of the simulations is achieved via a configuration file that allows not only for reproducibility of the presented results, but to simulate additional scenarios. We show a comparison to published results using TOUGH2, resulting in a good agreement between both simulators. We present a sensitivity study where the impact of different modelling choices (e.g., using a well model where the flow is uniform, or the flow adapts to the reservoir connectivity) is assessed. Simulations in heterogeneous layered systems using the facie properties from the recent SPE CSP11 problem definition is also presented. Finally, the effect of alternating injection/shut-in periods (1 year per period) is assessed for the same amount of injected CO2 in a time frame of eight years, resulting in 35 cases starting with CO2 injection. The results reveal that during more extended shut-in periods, salt precipitation is happening closer to the wellbore which confirms the effect of capillary pressure on imbibing more brine into the dried regions. Quantities such as solubility trapping and the integral of the well bottomhole pressure over time (used as an energy proxy) highly depend on the intermittency pattern.},
